# HomeMadeNeuralNet
I made this Neural Network in python with using some numpy. All aspects of the Machine Learning principles are built from scratch. 
I used it to recognize digits in MNIST, and it performed pretty well. I also later made some modifications and tried to use it on CIFAR-10, 
this Neural Network did not do nearly as well on that data set.
